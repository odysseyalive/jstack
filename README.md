## What is JStack?

JStack is your AI Second Brainâ€”a modular Bash-driven system for deploying and managing web services, automations, and sites on Debian 12 using Docker and NGINX. Itâ€™s designed to save you time, automate repetitive tasks, and give you full control over your infrastructure and data. If youâ€™re tired of manual server setup, endless config headaches, and worrying about security, JStack is here to make your life easier. You get a complete, production-ready stack in minutes, not hours.

JStack is built for real-world business owners, developers, and automation enthusiasts. You donâ€™t need to be a DevOps expertâ€”just follow the steps, and let JStack handle the heavy lifting. Your data stays yours, your workflows run 24/7, and you can focus on what matters.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Ready to get started? Check out [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for a step-by-step guide. Youâ€™ll be up and running in 15 minutes or less. All you need is a Debian 12 server, a domain name, and sudo access.

## Features

- One-command install: Docker, Docker Compose, NGINX, Certbot (SSL), and Fail2ban
- Modular service management: n8n, Supabase, NGINX, Chrome/Puppeteer, site templates
- Secure by default: environment-based secrets, production configs, firewall, SSL, fail2ban, rootless containers
- Dry-run mode: preview every action before you commit
- Diagnostics, compliance, backup/restore, multi-site support
- Site template lifecycle management and rapid deployment
- Integrated config validation and propagation
- Health monitoring, logging, and automatic restarts

## Usage

### Standard Installation (Recommended for Most Users)

1. **Create a dedicated jarvis user and add it to the docker group (run as root):**

 ```bash
 adduser jarvis
 ```

2. **Add your user to the docker group:**

 ```bash
 usermod -aG docker jarvis
 ```

3. **Switch to your jarvis user (login shell):**

 ```bash
 su - jarvis
 ```

4. **Clone the repository:**

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/odysseyalive/jstack.git
 ```

5. **Navigate to the directory:**

 ```bash
 cd jstack
 ```

6. **Refresh sudo credentials:**

 ```bash
 sudo -v
 ```

7. **Install and configure the full stack:**

 ```bash
 ./jstack.sh --install
 ```

### Service Management

**Start/stop services:**

```bash
./jstack.sh up
./jstack.sh down
./jstack.sh restart
./jstack.sh status
```

### Diagnostics & Validation

**Run diagnostics and compliance checks:**

```bash
./jstack.sh diagnostics <service>
./jstack.sh compliance <service>
./jstack.sh validate
```

**Validate setup before making changes:**

```bash
./jstack.sh --dry-run
```

### Advanced Site Deployment (For Power Users)

Want to deploy a custom site from a template? Copy a template to `sites/your-site`, edit the config, and run:

```bash
./jstack.sh --install-site sites/your-site
```

This is for advanced users who want to go beyond the default stack and launch custom web apps or landing pages.

## Documentation

New to JStack? These guides will help you understand each component:

- **[Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md)** - Step-by-step installation walkthrough
- **[Service Architecture](docs/services.md)** - Understanding n8n, Supabase, NGINX, and Chrome
- **[Docker & Containers](docs/docker.md)** - How JStack uses Docker for isolation and management
- **[SSL & Security](docs/security.md)** - Certificates, fail2ban, and security best practices
- **[Site Templates](docs/site-templates.md)** - Creating and deploying custom sites
- **[Backup & Recovery](docs/backup.md)** - Data protection and disaster recovery
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Security & Operations

- SSL certificates via Certbot (Let's Encrypt) for all domains
- NGINX reverse proxy with security headers and rate limiting
- Fail2ban for SSH and NGINX protection
- Automated backups and restore
- Health checks and compliance validation
- Rootless containers and network isolation

## Troubleshooting & Support

If you hit a snag, donâ€™t panic. Check logs in the `logs/` directory:

```bash
cat logs/install.log
```

Validate your setup:

```bash
./jstack.sh --dry-run
```

Restart services:

```bash
./jstack.sh --restart-services
```

For template issues, make sure `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` are present and correct in your site directory.

## Advanced & Customization

JStack is built to be extended. Add new site templates in `site-templates/`, customize your config in `jstack.config.default`, and extend scripts in `scripts/core/` and `scripts/services/` to fit your needs. Power users can automate anythingâ€”from landing pages to full SaaS apps.

## Workspace Directory Structure & Volume Mapping

All service data, configs, logs, and SSL certs are mapped to your working directory for easy access, backup, and portability. No system directories are usedâ€”everything is managed in your workspace.

```
/home/francis/lab/jstack/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/        # Supabase Postgres data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ n8n/             # n8n workflow data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chrome/          # Chrome/Puppeteer data
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conf.d/          # NGINX site configs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nginx.conf       # Main NGINX config
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ssl/             # SSL certs (Certbot)
â”œâ”€â”€ site-templates/      # Site template sources
â”œâ”€â”€ sites/               # Deployed custom sites
â”œâ”€â”€ backups/             # Automated backups
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                # Install and service logs
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/core/        # Core automation scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/services/    # Service lifecycle scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ jstack.config.default# User config
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml   # Service orchestration
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Docker Volume Mapping

- Supabase: `./data/supabase:/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- n8n: `./data/n8n:/home/node/.n8n`
- Chrome: `./data/chrome:/data`
- NGINX: `./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d`, `./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`, `./nginx/ssl:/etc/letsencrypt`
- Site templates: `./site-templates:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro`

### Permission Requirements

- All workspace files are owned by the deploying user and in the `docker` group.
- Run `scripts/core/fix_workspace_permissions.sh` after install/restore to fix any permission issues.
- Containers run as non-root where possible for security.

### Backup & Restore

- All backups are stored in `backups/` and include only workspace-mapped data.
- Restore by extracting backup files into your workspace and running permission fix script.

### Troubleshooting

- If a service cannot access its data/config, check directory ownership and permissions.
- Use `cat logs/install.log` for install and error logs.
- For permission issues, run:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/core/fix_workspace_permissions.sh
  ```
