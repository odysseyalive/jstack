# Nginx Configuration Directory

This directory contains the nginx configuration for JStack.

## Files

- `nginx.conf` - Main nginx configuration (static)
- `conf.d/` - Directory for site configurations (generated dynamically)
- `ssl/` - Legacy SSL directory (may be used by some scripts)
- `certbot/` - Let's Encrypt certificates and challenge files (generated by SSL script)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not manually edit files in `conf.d/`** - they are generated automatically during installation based on your domain configuration.

The SSL setup script will automatically create:
- `conf.d/default.conf`
- `conf.d/api.{DOMAIN}.conf`
- `conf.d/studio.{DOMAIN}.conf`
- `conf.d/n8n.{DOMAIN}.conf`
- `conf.d/chrome.{DOMAIN}.conf`

These files will use your actual domain instead of "example.com".
